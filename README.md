# Classification of hand-written digits using a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The objective of this example project is to illustrates how to work in STACKn to develop and deploy a basic model. The classical benchmark problem of classifying hand-written digits in the MNIST dataset is used as a demonstrator. 

## 1. Uploading training and test data

## 2. Developing the model in Labs 

## 3. Creating and generating reports

## 4. Deploying the model

## 5. Publishing the model as to the public model portal
